# securing
 its coders are visiable but because it is a locker program, if you wonna use it the right way, sohuld make it more secure.
 exe.xll is '7-zip.exe' main file.
xl.xll and x.xll are c++ codes to make CMD more graphical, you can use then by changing extension to '.exe'.

You can perform a lot of upgrades to it, for example hashing name-streams in .cmd files and coding them to secure it.
